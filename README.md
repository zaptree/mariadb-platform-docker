# MariaDB Platform Docker

Go [HERE](single-container/README.md) for full details on Single Container Image.

This project contains tools, utilities, scripts and Dockerfiles for setting up MariaDB Platform in docker containers.  MariaDB Platform combines MariaDB Server transactional capabilities, MariaDB Columnstore analytical capabilities, and the security and intelligent routing of MariaDB Maxscale into a single unified product with the flexibility to meet a wide range of requirements. As an example, see the Knowledgebase section on supporting [Hybrid Transactional Analytical Application Processing (HTAP) with MariaDB Platform](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/sample-platform-x3-implementation-for-transactional-and-analytical-workloads/).

With a wide range of possible topologies for MariaDB Plaform installations into Docker (and Kubernetes) environments, the initial demand has been to provide a simple way for users to experience MariaDB Platform, excercise its functionality and to begin developing applications.  This demand has driven the release of the **MariaDB Platform Single Container Image**. Follow [these instructions](single-container/README.md) to get started with the image.
